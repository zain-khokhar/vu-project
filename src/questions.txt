Answer:  The 2-bit Comparator discussed earlier is considered to be a Parallel Comparator as all the bits are compared simultaneously. External Logic has to be used to Cascade together two such Comparators to form a 4-bit Comparator.
Question No: 18   ( Marks: 2 )  Explain at least two advantages of the circuit having low power consumption :  Answer:  Power Dissipation  Logic Gates and Logic circuits consume varying amount of power during their operation.  Ideally, logic gates and logic circuit should consume minimal power. Advantages of low power consumption are circuits that can be run from batteries instead of mains power supplies. Thus portable devices that run on batteries use Integrated circuits that have low power dissipation. Secondly, low power consumption means less heat is dissipated by the logic devices; this means that logic gates can be tightly packed to reduce the circuit size without having to worry about dissipating the access heat generated by the logic devices.  Microprocessors for example generate considerable heat which has to be dissipated by mounting small fans. Generally, the Power dissipation of TTL devices remains constant throughout their operation. CMOS device on the other hand dissipate varying amount power depending upon the frequency of operation.  Question No: 19   ( Marks: 2 )  Name the four OLMC configurations  Answer:  The four OLMC configurations are  •   Combination Mode with active-low output  •   Combinational Mode with active-high output  •   Registered Mode with active-low output  •   Registered Mode with active-high output
Question No: 20   ( Marks: 3 )  Explain “Test Vector” in context of ABEL  Answer:  The programming of a PLD device involves entering the logic function in the form of a Boolean equation, truth table or a state diagram. Any errors during the entry process are corrected. The software compiler processes the information in the input file and translates it into a suitable format. The complier also minimizes the logic. The minimized logic is then tested by using a set of hypothetical inputs known as test vectors. The testing verifies the design of the logic circuit before committing it to the PLD.  Question No: 22   ( Marks: 5 )  Explain Tri-State Buffers with the help of block diagram  Answer:  Tri-State Buffers  Tri-State Buffer is a NOT gate with a control line that disconnects the output from the input. When the control line is high the buffer operates like a NOT gate and when the control line is low the output is disconnected from the output and high impedance is seen at the output. Tri-state buffers are used to disconnect the outputs of devices which are connected or share a common output line. Figure 20.9  Figure 20.9a Tri-State Buffer  Question No: 23   ( Marks: 5 )  Explain the Operation of Odd-Parity Generator Circuit with the help of timing diagram  Answer:  Operation of Odd-Parity Generator Circuit
The timing diagram shows the operation of the Odd-Parity generator circuit. Figure 14.3.  The A, B, C and D timing diagrams represent the changing 4-bit data values. During time interval t0 the 4-bit data value is 0000, during time interval t1, the data value changes to  0001.  Similarly during time intervals t2, t3, t4 up to t8 the data values change to 0010, 0011, 0100 and 1000 respectively. During interval t0 the output of the two XOR gates is 0 and  0, therefore the output of the XNOR gate is 1. At interval t1, the outputs of the two XOR gates is 1 and 0, therefore the output of the XNOR gate is 0. The output P can similarly be traced for intervals t2 to t8.

Answer:  The circuit of the 1-to-4 Demultiplexer is similar to the 2- to-4 Binary Decoder described earlier figure 16.9. The only difference between the two is the addition of the Data Input line, which is used as enable line in the 2-to-4 Decoder circuit figure  Question No: 20   ( Marks: 3 )  Name the three declarations that are included in “declaration  s ection” of the module that is created when an Input (source)  file is created in ABEL.  Answer:  Device declaration, pin declarations and set declarations.  Question No: 21   ( Marks: 5 )  Explain with example how noise affects Operation of a CMOS AND Gate circuit.  Answer:
Two CMOS 5 volt series AND gates are connected together. Figure 7.3 The first AND gate has both its inputs connected to logic high, therefore the output of the gate is guaranteed to be logic high. The logic high voltage output of the first AND gate is assumed to be 4.6 volts well within the valid VOH range of 5-4.4 volts. Assume the same noise signal (as described earlier) is added to the output signal of the first AND gate.  Question No: 22   ( Marks: 10 )  explain the SOP based implementation   of the Adjacent 1s  Detector Circuit :  Answer:  The Adjacent 1s Detector accepts 4-bit inputs. If two adjacent 1s are detected in the input, the output is set to high. The operation of the Adjacent 1s Detector is represented by the function table. Table 13.6. In the function table, for the input combinations 0011, 0110, 0111, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110 and 1111 the output function is a 1.  Implementing the circuit directly from the function table based on the SOP form requires 8 AND gates for the 8 product terms (minterms) with an 8-input OR gate. Figure 13.3.  The total gate count is  •   One 8 input OR gate  •   Eight 4 input AND gates  •   Ten NOT gates  The expression can be simplified using a Karnaugh map, figure 13.4, and then the simplified expression can be implemented to reduce the gate count. The simplified expression
isAB + CD +BC . The circuit implemented using the expression AB + CD +BC has reduced to 3 input OR gate and 2 input AND gates.  The simplified Adjacent 1s Detector circuit uses only four gates reducing the cost, the size of the circuit and the power requirement. The propagation delay of the circuit is of the order of two gates  ASSALAM O ALAIKUM all fellows  ALL IN ONE Mega File  CS302 Midterm PAPERS,  MCQz & subjective  Created BY Farhan& Ali  BS (cs) 3rd sem  Hackers Group  Mandi Bahauddin  Remember us in your prayers  Mindhacker124@gmail.com  Hearthacker124@gmail.com  Paper # 3  MIDTERM   EXAMINATION

Question No: 19   ( Marks: 2 )  Explain   Combinational Function Devices?  Ans;  Xor, Xnor, NAND, NOR are combinational function devices.  Question No: 20   ( Marks: 3 )  Differentiate between hexadecimal and octal number system  Answer:  Octal - base 8  Hexadecimal - base 16  Octal and hex are used to represent numbers instead of decimal because there is a very easy and direct way to convert from the "real" way that computers store numbers (binary) to something easier for humans to handle (fewer symbols). To translate a binary number to octal, simply group the binary digits three at a time and convert each group. For hex, group the binary digits four at a time.  Question No: 21   ( Marks: 5 )  Explain “Sum -of- Weights Method” for Hexadecimal to Decimal  Conversion with at least one example ?  Answer:
The hexadecimal (Hex) numbering system provides even shorter notation than octal. Hexadecimal uses a base of 16. It employs 16 digits: number 0 through 9, and letters A through F, with A through F substituted for numbers 10 to 15, respectively,  Hexadecimal numbers can be expressed as their decimal equivalents by using the sum of weights method, as shown in the following example:  Weight   2   1   0  Hex. Number 1   B   7  7   x 16 0   = 7 x 1   =   7  11 x 16 1   = 11x 16   =   176  1   x 16 2   = 1   x 256 =   256  Sum of products   439 10  Like octal numbers, hexadecimal numbers can easily be converted to binary or vise versa. Conversion is accomplished by writing the 4-bit binary equivalent of the hex digit for each position, as illustrated in the following example:  Hex. Number 1   B   7  0001   1011   0111   Binary number  Hexadecimal   Binary   Decimal  0   0000   0  1   0001   1  2   0010   2  3   0011   3  4   0100   4  5   0101   5  6   0110   6  7   0111   7

Question No: 17   ( Marks: 1 )  Briefly state the basic principle of   Repeated Division-by-2  method.  Repeated Division-by-2  Repeated Division-by-2 method allows decimal numbers of any magnitude to be converted into binary. In this method the Decimal number to be converted into its Binary equivalent is repeatedly divided by 2. The divisor is selected as 2 because the decimal number is being converted into Binary a Base-2 Number system. Repeated division method can be used to convert decimal number into any Number system by repeated division by the Base-Number. For example, the decimal number can be converted into the Caveman Number system by repeatedly dividing by 5, the Base number of the Caveman Number System. The Repeated
Division method will be used in latter lectures to convert decimal into Hexadecimal and Octal Number Systems.  In the Repeated-Division method the Decimal number to be converted is divided by the Base Number, in this particular case 2. A quotient value and a remainder value is generated, both values are noted done. The remainder value in all subsequent divisions would be either a 0 or a 1. The quotient value obtained as a result of division by 2 is divided again by 2. The new quotient and remainder values are again noted down. In each step of the repeated division method the remainder values are noted down and the quotient values are repeatedly divided by the base number. The process of repeated division stops when the quotient value becomes zero. The remainders that have been noted in consecutive steps are written out to indicate the Binary equivalent of the Original Decimal Number.  Question No: 18   ( Marks: 1 )  Briefly state the basic principle of   Repeated Multiplication-by- 2   Method.  Repeated Multiplication-by-2 Method  An alternate to the Sum-of-Weights method used to convert Decimal fractions to equivalent Binary fractions is the repeated multiplication by 2 methods. In this method the number to be converted is repeatedly multiplied by the Base Number to which the number is being converted to, in this case 2. A new number having an Integer part and a  Fraction part is generated after each multiplication. The Integer part is noted down and the fraction part is again multiplied with the Base number 2. The process is repeated until the fraction term becomes equal to zero.  Repeated Multiplication-by-2 method allows decimal fractions of any magnitude to be easily converted into binary. The conversion of Decimal fraction 0.625 into Binary equivalent using the
Repeated Multiplication-by-2 method is illustrated in a tabular form.  Table 2.4. Reading the Integer column from bottom to top and placing a decimal point in the left most position gives 0.101 the binary equivalent of decimal fraction 0.625  Question No: 19   ( Marks: 2 )  Draw the circuit diagram of a Tri-State buffer.  Question No: 20   ( Marks: 3 )  Add -13 and +7 by converting them in binary system your result must be in binary.  Question No: 21   ( Marks: 5 )  Explain “Sum of Weights” method with example for “Octal to Decimal” conversion  1. Sum-of-Weights Method  Sum-of-weights as the name indicates sums the weights of the Binary Digits (bits) of a Binary Number which is to be
represented in Decimal. The Sum-of-Weights method can be used to convert a Binary number of any magnitudes to its equivalent Decimal representation.  In the Sum-of-Weights method an extended expression is written in terms of the Binary Base Number 2 and the weights of the Binary number to be converted. The weights correspond to each of the binary bits which are multiplied by the corresponding binary value. Binary bits having the value 0 do not contribute any value towards the final sum expression.  The Binary number 101102 is therefore written in the form of an expression having weights 0   1   2   3   4  2 ,2 ,2 ,2 AND 2   corresponding to the bits 0, 1, 1, 0 and 1 respectively.  Weights 0   3  2 AND 2   do not contribute in the final sum as the binary bits corresponding to these weights have the value 0.  101102 = 4   3   2   1   0  1 x 2   0 x 2   1 x 2   1 x 2   0 x 2            = 16 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 0  = 22  Question No: 22   ( Marks: 10 )  Explain the Implementation of an Odd-Parity Generator Circuit i.e by drawing function table, maping it to K-map and then simplifying the expression.
