    description: `<h2>CS304: Object Oriented Programming</h2><p>Welcome to <strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>, a foundational course that introduces a powerful paradigm for software design and development. This course moves beyond procedural programming to teach you how to structure applications around <em>data</em> and <em>objects</em> rather than just functions and logic. You will learn to model real-world problems in a way that is more intuitive, manageable, and scalable, leading to code that is reusable, flexible, and easier to maintain.</p><p>The course begins with the core principles of OOP, establishing a strong foundation in concepts that are universal across many programming languages like Java, C++, Python, and C#. We will explore how to define classes, which act as blueprints for creating objects. You will understand how to encapsulate data and behavior within these objects, protecting data from outside interference and simplifying the overall program structure. This principle of encapsulation is the first pillar of object-oriented design.</p><h3>Key Topics Covered:</h3><ul><li><strong>Classes and Objects:</strong> The fundamental building blocks of OOP. Learn to define classes, create instances (objects), and use constructors and destructors.</li><li><strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit, and restricting access to implementation details.</li><li><strong>Inheritance:</strong> A mechanism for creating new classes that reuse, extend, and modify the behavior defined in existing classes. This promotes code reusability (the 'is-a' relationship).</li><li><strong>Polymorphism:</strong> The ability for an object to take on many forms. You will learn about method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).</li><li><strong>Abstraction:</strong> Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object or system. We will explore abstract classes and interfaces.</li><li><strong>Additional Concepts:</strong> Understanding static vs. instance members, 'this' pointer/reference, friend functions (in C++), and basic association/aggregation.</li></ul><h3>Course Objectives:</h3><ol><li>Understand the core principles and benefits of the object-oriented paradigm.</li><li>Design and implement classes and objects to model real-world problems.</li><li>Effectively use inheritance and polymorphism to create flexible and reusable code.</li><li>Apply abstraction and encapsulation to build robust and maintainable software.</li><li>Gain practical experience by developing object-oriented solutions to programming challenges.</li></ol><p>By the end of this course, you will have a solid grasp of object-oriented concepts and the ability to apply them to build sophisticated, well-structured software applications. This skillset is essential for any aspiring software engineer or developer in the modern tech industry.</p>`,

    description: `<h2>CS605: Software Engineering-II</h2><p><strong>CS605 Software Engineering-II</strong> builds upon the foundational principles of software development (covered in Software Engineering-I) to explore the <em>management</em> and <em>process</em> aspects of building large-scale, industrial-strength software. While the first course focused on the technical 'how' of building software (analysis, design, coding, testing), this course focuses on the 'how-to-manage' building software, especially in a team environment.</p><p>This course delves into the activities related to managing the software development lifecycle. You will learn about software process models, project management, quality assurance, and the professional responsibilities of a software engineer. The focus shifts from individual programming to the coordination of teams, resources, and schedules to deliver a high-quality product on time and within budget.</p><h3>Key Topics Covered:</h3><ul><li><strong>Software Process Models:</strong> A deeper look at various development lifecycles beyond the traditional Waterfall model. This includes iterative models (like the Spiral model), agile methodologies (like Scrum and XP), and the V-Model.</li><li><strong>Project Management:</strong> Key activities for managing a software project, including <em>project planning</em>, <em>cost and effort estimation</em> (e.g., COCOMO), <em>scheduling</em> (Gantt charts, PERT charts), and <em>risk management</em>.</li><li><strong>Software Quality Assurance (SQA):</strong> Understanding the difference between quality assurance (process-oriented) and quality control (product-oriented). This includes formal technical reviews, standards (like ISO 9000), and process improvement models (like CMMI).</li><li><strong>Software Configuration Management (SCM):</strong> The discipline of managing the evolution of a software system. This includes <em>version control</em> (using tools like Git), <em>change control</em>, and build management.</li><li><strong>Software Testing Strategies:</strong> Moving beyond unit testing to explore integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. We will also discuss test case design, black-box vs. white-box testing, and debugging strategies.</li><li><strong>Software Maintenance:</strong> Understanding the different types of maintenance (corrective, adaptive, perfective) and the challenges of managing software after its initial release.</li></ul><h3>Course Objectives:</h3><ol><li>Understand and compare different software development process models, including agile methodologies.</li><li>Apply key project management techniques for planning, estimation, and scheduling.</li><li>Grasp the principles of Software Quality Assurance and process improvement.</li><li>Implement Software Configuration Management practices, including version control.</li><li>Develop comprehensive testing strategies for large-a_scale systems.</li></ol><p>CS605 provides the essential non-technical skills that are critical for success in a professional software engineering career.

Unlike a standard operational database (OLTP) which is optimized for fast transactions (like placing an order), a data warehouse (OLAP) is optimized for complex queries that analyze historical data (like "What were the total sales of our top 10 products, by region, for each of the last 12 quarters ? ").</p><p>This course is a cornerstone of <strong>Business Intelligence (BI)</strong>. You will learn the entire process of taking raw data from various, heterogeneous sources (e.g., sales, marketing, HR databases), cleaning and transforming it, and loading it into a unified "single source of truth" for decision-making.
